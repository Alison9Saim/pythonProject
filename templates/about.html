    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Would You Rather</strong> — a simple but addictive game
      where you choose between two options and see how your choice compares with
      everyone else’s. It’s a fun way to spark conversations, challenge your
      instincts, and laugh at the surprising results.
    </p>

    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You’ll be presented with a question and two possible answers.</li>
      <li>Pick the option you prefer — Option A or Option B.</li>
      <li>See how many other players agreed with you.</li>
      <li>Earn points for picking the more popular choice!</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Why We Built It</h4>
    <p>
      We wanted to create a lighthearted game that anyone can play in seconds.
      Whether you’re killing time, debating with friends, or just curious about
      what people think, this game is designed to entertain and connect.
    </p>

    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Randomized questions pulled from our game database.</li>
      <li>Instant feedback on how your choice compares.</li>
      <li>Funny “loss messages” when you pick the less popular option.</li>
      <li>Simple scoring system to keep track of your streaks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Future Plans</h4>
    <p>
      We’re working on adding more questions, themed categories, and multiplayer
      modes so you can challenge your friends directly. Stay tuned!
