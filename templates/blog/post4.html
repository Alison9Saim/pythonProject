      <strong>Would You Rather</strong> taps into curiosity and social comparison. People love seeing how their choices stack up against others. The game creates instant conversation starters, sparks debates, and reveals hidden preferences. Psychologists call this “decision play” — a safe way to explore values without real‑world consequences. That’s why it’s so engaging: every choice feels meaningful, even when it’s silly.
