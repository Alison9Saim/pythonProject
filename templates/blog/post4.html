      <strong>Would You Rather</strong> taps into curiosity and social comparison. People love seeing how their choices stack up against others. The game creates instant conversation starters, sparks debates, and reveals hidden preferences. Psychologists call this “decision play” — a safe way to explore values without real‑world consequences. That’s why it’s so engaging: every choice feels meaningful, even when it’s silly.

      <h4>Coming Soon: Submit Your Own Questions</h4>
      <p>
        We’re excited to announce that soon, <strong>you</strong> will be able to submit your own
        hilarious, thought‑provoking, or downright tricky “Would You Rather” questions directly into the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once submitted, your questions will be added to the pool for other players to enjoy and respond to.
        This means the game will grow with community creativity, making every round more surprising and fun.
