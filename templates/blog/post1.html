    <p>
      <strong>Would You Rather</strong> taps into curiosity and social comparison. People love seeing how their choices stack up against others. The game creates instant conversation starters, sparks debates, and reveals hidden preferences. Psychologists call this “decision play” — a safe way to explore values without real‑world consequences. That’s why it’s so engaging: every choice feels meaningful, even when it’s silly.

    <p>
      Every answer reveals something about who we are. Choosing between comfort and risk, humor and seriousness,
      or fantasy and reality highlights the values we hold. Even the silliest scenarios can spark meaningful reflection.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Social Connection and Laughter</h4>
    <p>
      The game thrives in groups. Friends laugh at outrageous options, families debate over tricky dilemmas,
      and strangers bond over shared choices. It’s a simple way to break the ice and create memorable moments.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Safe Exploration</h4>
    <p>
      Because the stakes are imaginary, players can explore wild ideas without consequences.
      This freedom makes the game both entertaining and liberating — you can test your limits, embrace creativity,
      and discover new sides of yourself.
