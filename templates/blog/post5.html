    <h2 class="mb-4">What Your Choices Say About You</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">Published on Nov 18, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Every time you answer a <strong>Would You Rather</strong> question, you reveal a little piece of yourself.
      Your choices reflect your personality, your values, and sometimes even your sense of humor.
      While the game is lighthearted, the decisions you make can say a lot about how you think and what you prioritize.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">1. Humor and Playfulness</h4>
    <p>
      Choosing the sillier option often shows you enjoy laughter and don’t take life too seriously.
      It’s a reminder that fun and joy are just as important as logic.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">2. Risk vs. Comfort</h4>
    <p>
      Some questions test whether you lean toward adventure or safety.
      Picking the bold choice can highlight your willingness to take risks, while the safer option shows you value stability.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">3. Creativity and Imagination</h4>
    <p>
      Outlandish scenarios spark creativity. If you gravitate toward the more imaginative answers,
      it may reveal your love for storytelling, fantasy, and thinking outside the box.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">4. Social Connection</h4>
    <p>
      Many choices reflect how you interact with others.
      Do you prefer scenarios that make people laugh together, or ones that spark debate?
      Your answers can show whether you thrive on connection or enjoy standing out with unique perspectives.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">5. Values and Priorities</h4>
    <p>
      Even silly questions can reveal deeper values.
      Choosing comfort over challenge, or honesty over humor, can highlight what matters most to you in everyday life.
